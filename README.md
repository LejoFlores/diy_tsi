# Do-it-Yourself (DIY) Sky Imager (SI)

This repository contains code to facilitate the use of a 360 camera (like a Ricoh Theta) as an inexpensive a sky imager to estimate cloud coverage. It is anticipated, that code and materials included in this repository will include:

* Code to transform 2:1 panoramic images from a 360 camera into a "rabbit hole" hemispherical image oriented towards the sky
* Code to process images and estimate cloud cover from imagery and perform rudimentary quality assessment/control
* Code to facilitate labelling and training of ML-based models for cloud classification
* Data management code to organize imagery for subsequent post processing
* Plans for mounting options for cameras 
* Plans and code for 3-D printed solar occluders
